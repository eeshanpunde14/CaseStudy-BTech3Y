# CaseStudy-BTech3Y

The Github repository contains a machine learning algorithm designed to detect the void percentage in a system of circular particles vibrating in a bed. The algorithm uses VGG19 for feature detection and XGBoost for prediction. The dataset used to train the model was extracted from simulations performed on Liggghts, and the mean squared error (MSE) achieved by the model is 0.027. Overall, the repo provides an implementation of a reliable and accurate algorithm for void percentage detection in circular particle systems.
